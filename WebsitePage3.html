            <p> When researching combo's online you will often see annotations using numbers such as 6321456KS.
                The numbers refer to stick input assuming you are facing right, whilst the letters are which button
                input is being used.
                Every game used the same number system but the letters vary, such as a hadouken is 236P in Street
                Fighter.
                Often times you will hear shorthand in the form of something like double fireball as a way to say
                what inputs are needed, or you may hear quarter circle punch. Explaining inputs in this method is
                advantageous when you are more accustomed to the basics of fighting games as instead of stating the
                input as 236236P for double fireball the knowledge that 236P is a single fireball means upon picking
                up any new fighting games a quick look at special inputs is all it will take to get a grasp of playing
                the character.
                Most fighting games will have a combo tutorial made by other players to allow you to see and get used
                your characters combos and once you are more confident and can string your own you can upload yours to
                help others learn the character.

        <div class="Centre">
            <img src="Faultless_Defence.jpeg" alt="A character is blocking with a blue bubble around them"
                class="right-image">
            <p> On the fundamentals page we talked about the offensive phase. There are multiple techniques that are
                slightly more advanced to break open guards.
                <span class="keyword-text">Okizeme</span> is one such technique, on characters that can have disjointed attacks means your opponent has
                to block 2 different attacks that can be coming from different heights
                or directions. Most fighting game characters do not have the ability to do this, but those that do have
                the ability to apply above average pressure to defending players.
                Another technique that can be used is a <span class="keyword-text">high/low mix up</span>. As most attacks can only be blocked high or low
                by trying to make your opponent perform the wrong block.
                A <span class="keyword-text">left/right mix up</span> is similar to a high/low mix up except instead of block height it punishes block
                direction as blocking is always the opposite direction from where
                a character faces.
                A <span class="keyword-text">jump/throw mix</span> works on punishing opponents for jumping to avoid a grab as they cannot block an attack
                whilst initiating the jump. If you believe your opponent will
                jump whilst in the defensive phase a light attack like 6P will perform a knock down opening them up for
                a follow up combo.
                <span class="keyword-text">Frame traps</span> use the fact that combos generally do not have any frames where the opposing player can
                retaliate, so minor spacing in a combo allows the opponent
                to try start an animation that won't complete before yours connects to break open the opponents guard.
            </p>

            <p> On the defensive there are some more complex techniques. Some characters will have moves that are called
                <span class="keyword-text">Frame traps</span>counters, these are designed to punish attacks with a knockdown
                and some damage, forcing neutral to occur once again. Another technique is <span class="keyword-text">Frame traps</span>faultless defence. Faultless
                defence uses your super guage to reduce all incoming damage to 0,
                pushes the opponent back and can block supers. The knockback is substantial enough that it can force a
                neutral phase.

            <img src="Blue_Roman_Cancel.jpeg" alt="A blue aura encircling a character with a clock above the other"
                class="right-image">
            <p> In guilty Gear specifically there is a mechanic called the <span class="keyword-text">roman cancel</span>, this allows players to cancel
                move animations to allow the ability to ignore start up or end animations.
                When performing a roman cancel half of the super meter is used up and one of four different colours will
                occur.
                <span class="keyword-text">Red roman cancel</span> occurs if used when an attack hits allowing end animations to be canceled.
                <span class="keyword-text">Blue roman cancel</span> if the character is not attacking causes a brief period where the opponents actions
                are slowed.
                <span class="keyword-text">Yellow roman cancel</span> can only be used when blocking an attack, this causes a heavy knockback similar to
                burst without a knockdown.
                <span class="keyword-text">Purple roman cancel</span> can only be used in the last frames of an animation to cancel it into a follow up
                attack.
