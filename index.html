        <h3>Welcome to Fighting Games</h3>
        <p> The fighting game genre on the surface is a rather expansive and seems to require a lot of in-depth
            knowledge to be enjoyed.
            This is not the case.
            Often online you will hear a lot of terms thrown around which may seem complicated which this site hopes to
            make more accessible for players of all skill levels.
            To do this we will be using Guilty Gear Strive, a game made by Arc System Works in 2021 to explain and help
            visualise what these terms mean.</p>
